# Keyborad rgb control for ASUS ROG Series
Ive creating some scripts to download and setup rogauracore on your linux laptop. This would create a launcher for the script to change your color and brightness by input
Steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/drunckj/rog-rgb-control.git
cd rog-rgb-control/
sudo chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
after this you'll get a shortcut in your system with the name rogrgbcontrol 
## version 2 with gui will be out soon
